This is a simple web-based simulator that demonstrates the basics of cloud computing.

Developed for [Computing At School Scotland](http://www.cas.scot/) and the [School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/).


Usage
-----

All scripting is client-side, so your web server just needs to be able to serve the files, nothing more. Or, you can run it directly from the filesystem.
